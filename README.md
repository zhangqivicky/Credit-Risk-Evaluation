# Home Credit Default Risk Prediction
Credit risk evaluation is one of the important topics in finance. The evaluation is highly challenging and one of the main reasons is that the records of credit histories are sometimes not sufficient. As a result, many people struggle to get loans. The reason why people want to study this dataset is that they hope to help this underserved population have a positive loan experience. The primary task is to develop some reliable models to predict clients' repayment abilities and credit risk based on a variety of alternative data provided by Home Credit.

"target" variable is the prediction which indicates whether the user is positive or negative in credit risk.

The main reason why Home Credit wants to run this competition is to find more underserved population and provide lending service. They have used various machine learning models to make the predictions, and now they want to improve the performance of prediction so that some clients are not rejected due to insufficient data on credit. This action is business-motivated.
